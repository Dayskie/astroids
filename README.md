# astroids

Small game i'm working on to learn unity and some git

If you would like to try this yourself all you have to do is download the zip and open it inside of Unity, may release it on Itch.io or Newgrounds but for now it remains here :p

"game" is sort of working, you can destroy astroids, die and respawn, but astroids don't yet spawn in, there is no main menu or score tracking of any kind.
